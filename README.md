🍲 Recipe App
The Recipe App is a web application that allows users to search for recipes
by meal name and view detailed information about each recipe.
It is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript,
and uses the [TheMealDB API](https://www.themealdb.com/api.php) to fetch recipe data.

📖 How It Works
1. On the home page, users can type the name of a meal (e.g., "chicken") in the search box.  
2. The app fetches data from TheMealDB API and displays matching recipes in card format.  
3. Each recipe card shows:  
   - 📸 Meal Image  
   - 📝 Meal Name  
   - 🌍 Area (e.g., Italian, American)  
   - 🍴 Category (e.g., Dessert, Seafood)  
   - 🔗 A View Recipe button  
4. When users click View Recipe, a new page opens showing:  
   - Full-size meal image  
   - Meal title  
   - Category & Area  
   - Complete cooking instructions

The app is fully responsive, meaning it adjusts to desktop and mobile screens.
